<h1>gort (OTA:C08-ECHO-OWS-54687): one time i was in some sort of Star wars rp and i chose gonk, and because i got very used to saying gonk i just named it gort and made the gonk droid called gort gort (OTA:C08-ECHO-OWS-54687): gonk and gort are not the same, they're just named differently, altough i like to think that gort is just some malfunctioning gonk droid i have some plans of that gort could be like a snark or something like that gort (OTA:C08-ECHO-OWS-54687): most people think that gort is a vort tho lol</h1>
